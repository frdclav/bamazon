# bamazon


The purpose of this app is to explore nodejs and mysql. The app is a cli that roughly mimics a storefront like Amazon.

The bamazonCustomer.js app serves as the customer view for the app, allowing customers to view the items for sale and make an order.

The bamazonManager.js app serves as a backend view for a manager or admin, allowing them to add new products, increase the stock on existing product, etc.

The apps use mysql2 and inquirer packages.

Somethings that need to be done: 
* Try the Challenge #3 of adding a superviser view
* Refactoring the code, there seem to be a lot of places where I can clean up and make the code more effecient.
